# Learning
The repository organizes learning techniques and applications, aiming to be a resource for solutions and writing ideas.

Note:

Machine learning: "Acquiring knowledge by extracting patterns from raw data; data representation can critically determine the prediction performance."

Deep learning: "A machine learning approach whose data representation is based on building up a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined through its relation to simpler concepts."
