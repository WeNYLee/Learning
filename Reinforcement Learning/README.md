"Reinforcement learning is learning what to do - how to map situations to actions - so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them." [1]

In contrast to supervised learning, reinforcement learning does not rely on labeled inputs and outputs. Reinforcement learning aims to learn the optimal behaviors in an environment so as to achieve maximum reward.
