A few data are labeled. That is, most data are unlabeled. 

For example, for a general image dataset, there are relatively few images annotated with tags.

Include (a) transductive learning and (b) inductive learning, where
Transductive learning: unlabeled data == test set
Inductive learning: unlabeled data != testing set
