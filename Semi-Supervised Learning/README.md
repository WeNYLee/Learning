A few data are labeled. That is, most data are unlabeled. 

For example, for a general image dataset, there are relatively few images annotated with tags.

Include (a) transductive learning and (b) inductive learning, where transductive learning considers unlabeled data, while inductive learning does not. 

transductive learning: unlabeled data == test set, while
inductive learning: unlabeled data != testing set
