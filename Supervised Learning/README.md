Use labeled datasets to train a model so as to predict the outcomes. Generally, there are two main types of supervised learning problems, including regression and classification.

Regression: predict a number, such as the length of a table

Classification: predict a state, such as a music genre (Jazz, Rock, etc.). Generally, there are four types of classification tasks, including (1) binary classification, (2) multi-class classification, (3) multi-label classification, and (4) imbalanced classification.
