Data are unlabeled.

Methods include (1) clustering, (2) anomaly detection, and (3) approaches for learning latent variable models [1]. 

For clustering, the goal is to group a set of objects such that objects in the same group are more similar than those in the other groups. So far, there are many famous algorithms, such as k-means clustering and sequential clustering. 

For anomaly detection, the goal is to identify rare events or observations which are suspicious. That is, they are quite different from the standard ones. 

A latent variable model is used to relate a set of observable variables to a set of unobserved variables (i.e., latent variables).
