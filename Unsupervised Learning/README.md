Data are unlabeled.

Methods include (1) clustering, (2) anomaly detection, and (3) approaches for learning latent variable models [1]. 

For clustering, the goal is to group a set of objects such that objects in the same group are more similar than those in the other groups. So far, there are many famous algorithms, such as k-means clustering and sequential clustering. 

Given a parameter k, k-means clustering groups input instances into k groups, where instances in the same group are expected to be more similar than those in the other groups.

For anomaly detection, the goal is to identify rare events or observations which are suspicious. That is, they are quite different from the standard ones. 

A latent variable model is to relate a set of observable variables to a set of unobserved variables (i.e., latent variables).
