Data are unlabeled.

Methods include (1) clustering, (2) anomaly detection, and (3) approaches for learning latent variable models [1]. For clustering, the goal is to group a set of objects such that objects in the same group are more similar than those in the other groups. So far, there are many famous algorithms, such as k-means clustering and sequential clustering.
