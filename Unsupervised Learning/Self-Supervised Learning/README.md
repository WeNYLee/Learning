A type of unsupervised learning

Generative methods, 
Predictive methods,
Contrastive methods,
Booststrapping methods,
Simple extra regularization methods

Contrastive self-supervised learning uses both positive and negative examples, while non-contrastive one uses positive examples only.


Include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GAN is a deep learning framework. The framework typically has a generator and a discriminator, where the generator learns to produce obviously fake data, and the discriminator learns to tell if the data are fake or not. That is, the generative network generates candidates while the discriminative network evaluates them. [1]
