A type of unsupervised learning

Generative methods, 
Predictive methods,
Contrastive methods,
Booststrapping methods,
Simple extra regularization methods

Include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GAN has a generator and a discriminator, where the generator learns to produce obviously fake data, and the discriminator learns to tell if the data are fake or not.
