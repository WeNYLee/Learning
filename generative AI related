Regenerative AI
Regenerative AI is an emerging field that focuses on developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can learn and adapt to new situations,
similar to how biological systems regenerate and adapt to changes in their environment.

What is the difference between Generative and Regenerative AI

Generative AI — Unleashing Creativity

Generative AI gained significant traction with the advent of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
GANs, a specialized machine learning algorithm, empowered Generative AI to produce remarkably authentic 
images, videos, and audio clips of real individuals. This development propelled Generative 
AI to the forefront of technological advancements, paving the way for improved movie dubbing, enriched educational 
materials, and a plethora of other applications.
However, the rise of Generative AI also raised concerns about deep fakes and cybersecurity threats, 
including sophisticated impersonations of employees’ superiors.

The ability of GANs to generate realistic images, videos, and audio has had a profound impact on various industries. 
For instance, in the film industry, GANs are being used to create high-quality movie dubbing, allowing for seamless translation of films into multiple languages without compromising the original acting performances. Additionally, in the field of education, GANs are being employed to develop immersive and interactive learning experiences, bringing abstract concepts to life and enhancing student engagement.
